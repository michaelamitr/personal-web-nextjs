        Hi, I am Michaela and I am a curious and creative person. And also a

            I started my journey in March 2023, with a long term web development
            course, Digital Academy: Web by{' '}

            />
            . Why? Because I wanted to do something creative, something where I
            could use my good eye for detail and visual side of things, but also
            logical and analytical thinking. Front-end is the right place for
            me.

            I have been involved in several projects so far. My first project
            was <TextLink href="/portfolio/hike-it" text="Hike It" isBlank />. A
            graduation project processed within the Digital Academy. At my first
            developer job, I was involved in other projects for apartment
            developers â€“{' '}

            />
            . Apart from that, I am also a coach and mentor to people who are at
            the beginning of their journey in IT in Czechitas.

            I am continually working on myself, discovering new libraries,
            trying new features, getting deeper into front-end development and
            corresponding technologies. My stack is mostly focused on Next.js
            and TypeScript. Apart from front-end, I am also interested in
            cybersecurity and working on my Google Cybersecurity Professional
            Certificate.

            And last but not least, I am a passionate traveler. I love to meet
            new cultures and people I can inspire and get inspired by. Also, I
            truly enjoy DIY work like sewing, painting, embroidery and much
            more.
