We are on the same wavelength, but even though each of us came with a different opinion, we immediately resolved everything with a compromise to the satisfaction of both. Míša is a frontend enthusiast and has been my mentor many times when I was stuck with something and she already had experience with it. I would work with her again on another project and I would definitely recommend her to the team. In addition, she is not only good at programming, but she is creative and a divine photographer and painter.",
